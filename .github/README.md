# WolfHUD - AutoUpdate Support

## Description

This branch is to support automatic updates for WolfHUD.  
A push to this branch triggers a GitHUB action, which re-calculates the hash of the current master branch  
and writes it into the file _meta.json_.  
The game client checks your local version against this hash.  
If it differs, it will download the zip from the provided URL and extract it into your mods directory.
